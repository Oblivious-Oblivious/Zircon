## (âœ”) ver. 0.2.0 proposals
    ğŸŸ© Fix preprocessor grammar.
    ğŸŸ© `LF` mode on text editors mess up line feeds for the parser, `CRLF` works properly (fix).
    ğŸŸ© Check for custom class destructors.
    ğŸŸ© Refactor base code to be more modular.
    ğŸŸ© When main flag is raised, include all headers store in the `__zircon_main` file.
    ğŸŸ© Create an operator for casting to objects (without violating encapsulation rules).
    ğŸŸ© Messages cannot handle casting other objects atm only for objects of the same class.
    ğŸŸ© Rewrite cDataLib using Zircon.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.3.0 proposals
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix typedef names with identifiers.
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix preprocessor with typedefs.
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix selectors on different classes with same names (fix namespacing).
    ğŸŸ¥ Add a compiler setup file to include predefined names and preprocessor directives.
    ğŸŸ¥ Bypass the C preprocessor and write a custom one, that includes extending to messages and objects.
    ğŸŸ¥ Extend the object model allowing for more reflection.
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix nested message calls that now require parentheses.
    ğŸŸ¥ Generalize test suite and test files (write a simplified version of cSpec).
    ğŸŸ¥ Create a website to host code, where objects can be forked.
    ğŸŸ¥ Find a way to compile objects to DLLS, for independent redeployment.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add extension modules named `Fragments` (replace cEmerald) (make cSpec a fragment) (combine with cSpec).
    ğŸŸ¥ Write documentation, create a website, write an article.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.4.0 proposals
    ğŸŸ¥ Find a way to incorporate existing libraries with zircon (using some sort of object porting).
    ğŸŸ¥ Find a way to declare static functions inside classes.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add implicit, explicit calls to bypass compiler optimizations.
    ğŸŸ¥ Try avoid nullity checks, and implement specific action when an object turns out to be NULL.
    ğŸŸ¥ Try implementing automatic defer calls when out of block range (keep for implicit declarations).
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix spaces on text generation (implement a rudimentary form of a self hosting compiler).
    ğŸŸ¥ Declutter compilation steps.
    ğŸŸ© Fix `__init_Object()` declarations with independent compilation.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add object header files (yaml or list syntax) for documentation and enabling DLL compilation.
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix messages with the first parameter being a string needing parentheses.
    ğŸŸ¥ Implement void selectors choosing to translate a return statement or not according to return type.
    ğŸŸ¥ Remove the need for `#import "Object"`.
    ğŸŸ¥ Rewrite cSpec using Zircon.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.5.0 proposals
    ğŸŸ¥ When compiling two files without a main function, only the first gets translated properly (fix).
    ğŸŸ¥ Fix selectors returning void, by choosing at compile time whether to return or not.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add the callback method code for Object
    ğŸŸ¥ Override `new` and `defer` for better memory management.

## (âœ—) ver. 1.0.0 goals
    ğŸŸ¥ Make compiler self hosting.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add ability for object literals ("str" "call message", 2 "add one").
    ğŸŸ¥ Make the syntax LISP like, by encapsulating functionality in objects and messages.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add syntax highlighting for vscode and vim.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add an optimizing compiler.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add the ability for implementing custom preprocessor layers dynamically.
    ğŸŸ¥ Add GCC extensions grammar and (maybe) use the C preprocessor before Zircon.
    ğŸŸ¥ Implement the idea of parallel object execution and communication with events and messages.
