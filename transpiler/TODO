[九] ver. 0.2.0 proposals
------------------------
    [游릴] Fix preprocessor grammar.
    [游릴] `LF` mode on text editors mess up line feeds for the parser, `CRLF` works properly (fix).
    [游릴] Check for custom class destructors.
    [游릴] Refactor base code to be more modular.
    [游릴] When main flag is raised, include all headers store in the `__zircon_main` file.
    [仇] Create an operator for casting to objects (without violating encapsulation rules).
    [仇] Messages cannot handle casting other objects atm only for objects of the same class.
    [游릴] Rewrite cDataLib using Zircon.

[九됳 ver. 0.3.0 proposals
------------------------
    [游린] Fix selectors on different classes with same names (fix namespacing).
    [游린] Add a compiler setup file to include predefined names and preprocessor directives.
    [游린] Fix typedef names with identifiers.
    [游린] Fix preprocessor with typedefs.
    [游린] Bypass the C preprocessor and write a custom one, that includes extending to messages and objects.
    [游린] Extend the object model allowing for more reflection.
    [游린] Fix nested message calls that now require parentheses.
    [游린] Generalize test suite and test files (write a simplified version of cSpec).
    [游린] Create a website to host code, where objects can be forked.
    [游린] Find a way to compile objects to DLLS, for independent redeployment.
    [游린] Add extension modules named `Fragments` (replace cEmerald) (make simple-cSpec a fragment) (combine with simple-cSpec).
    [游린] Write documentation, create a website, write an article.

[九됳 ver. 0.4.0 proposals
------------------------
    [游린] Find a way to incorporate existing libraries with zircon (using some sort of object porting).
    [游린] Find a way to declare static functions inside classes.
    [游린] Add implicit, explicit calls to bypass compiler optimizations.
    [游린] Try avoid nullity checks, and implement specific action when an object turns out to be NULL.
    [游린] Try implementing automatic defer calls when out of block range (keep for implicit declarations).
    [游린] Fix spaces on text generation (implement a rudimentary form of a self hosting compiler).
    [游린] Declutter compilation steps.
    [游린] Fix `__init_Object()` declarations with independent compilation.
    [游린] Add object header files (yaml or list syntax) for documentation and enabling DLL compilation.
    [游린] Fix messages with the first parameter being a string needing parentheses.
    [游린] Implement void selectors choosing to translate a return statement or not according to return type.
    [游린] Remove the need for `#import "Object"`.
    [游린] Rewrite cSpec using Zircon.

[九됳 ver. 1.0.0 goals
--------------------
    [游린] Make compiler self hosting.
    [游린] Add ability for object literals ("str" "call message", 2 "add one").
    [游린] Make the syntax LISP like, by encapsulating functionality in objects and messages.
    [游린] Add syntax highlighting for vscode and vim.
    [游린] Add an optimizing compiler.
    [游린] Add the ability for implementing custom preprocessor layers dynamically.
    [游린] Add GCC extensions grammar and (maybe) use the C preprocessor before Zircon.
    [游린] Implement the idea of parallel object execution and communication with events and messages.
